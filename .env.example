# Environment Configuration Template
# ========================================
#
# This file documents the environment variables you can use to configure
# the Node.js tutorial server. By default, the server works without any
# configuration, but you can customize its behavior using these variables.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Edit the .env file with your custom values
# 3. The server will automatically read your .env file (if using dotenv)
#
# NOTE: This tutorial uses process.env directly, so you'll need to set
# environment variables when starting the server:
#   PORT=8080 node server.js
#
# OR set them in your shell before running:
#   export PORT=8080
#   npm start
#
# ========================================

# PORT
# The port number where the HTTP server will listen for requests.
# 
# Default: 3000 (Node.js development standard)
# Type: Number
# 
# When to change:
#   - Port 3000 is already in use by another application
#   - Your hosting provider requires a specific port
#   - You want to run multiple instances on different ports
#
# Examples:
#   PORT=3000  (default - standard Node.js development port)
#   PORT=8080  (alternative common development port)
#   PORT=5000  (another popular choice)
#
PORT=3000
